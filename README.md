# ReduxReact_Boilerplate

This is a Boilerplate based on this repository: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter and it is used for learning purposes only.

The modifications made to it were done only to allow the correct use with Vagrant or on Cloud9. It also has the auto refresh feature.

PS.: This runs with Vagrant on IP 0.0.0.0. If you use on another address change the host configuration on the webpack.config.js file (line 27).
